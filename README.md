This model was developed with Paul E. Smaldino.

Here is [an early rough draft](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/gid03_draft_045.pdf) and an accompanying supplemental (which is split into [partA](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/supplemental_partA_11-13-2024.pdf) and [partB](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/supplemental_partB_11-13-2024.pdf) for file size reasons).



Here is some sample code [here](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/tree/main/code). The .ipynb files are the notebooks used to run simulations. Many sections of the paper have simulation results from more than one notebook. But, I've included at least one notebook for the models in each section: [Section 3.3](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212-Copy3.ipynb) [Section 3.5](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212signals.ipynb) [Section 3.7](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_SF_top213signals-Copy1.ipynb) [Section 3.9](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_top_intersec.ipynb) [Section 3.10](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topA-Copy4.ipynb) [Section 3.11](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repexec_SMARTmutate_top_23D-Copy7.ipynb) [Section 3.12](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topC-Copy4.ipynb). All of these notebooks call functions from [this file](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/FNs_genBachStravinsky_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_rep_execNULLsig_SMARTmutation.py), which must be located in the same directory as the notebooks for them to work properly. The code was only commented for my own use, and I am happy to provide further explainations of the code via email correspondence. I always record the random entropy used to seed the random number generators so results can be replicated exactly if the need arises.
