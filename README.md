This model was developed with Adrian Bell and Paul E. Smaldino.

Here is [an early rough draft](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/gid03_draft_066_split_from_overleaf_04.pdf) and an accompanying supplemental (which is split into [partA](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/supplemental_partA_11-13-2024.pdf) and [partB](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/supplemental_partB_11-13-2024.pdf) for file size reasons). While all stages of developing and explaining the model in this draft were done through close collaboration with Adrian Bell and Paul E. Smaldino, the words in this draft are my own and do not reflect substantive imporovements that both of my co-authors have made to the paper. Since I am early in my career and do not have many examples of my own writing about cultural evolution, I want to at least have something to point to that reflects my proficiency in the area of research. That's what this early draft is. It does not reflect the current state of the paper. I also want to be clear that I have from the start received extensive guidance and feedback from both Adrian and Paul on the development of this draft. So while I believe it does reflect my proficiency at research on cultural evolution, it does not reflect my capacity for research on my own without guidance, cunstructive dialogue, and regular feedback.



Here is some sample code [here](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/tree/main/code). The .ipynb files are the notebooks used to run simulations. Many sections of the paper have simulation results from more than one notebook. But, I've included at least one notebook for the models in each section: [Section 3.3](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212-Copy3.ipynb) [Section 4.2](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repNOexec_sm_sweep_Merced_top212signals.ipynb) [Section 4.4](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_SF_top213signals-Copy1.ipynb) [Section 5.1](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_top_intersec.ipynb) [Section 5.2](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topA-Copy4.ipynb) [Section 5.3](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repexec_SMARTmutate_top_23D-Copy7.ipynb) [Section 5.4](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/genBS_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_repEXEC_sm_sweep_Merced_topC-Copy4.ipynb). All of these notebooks call functions from [this file](https://github.com/nathanlgabriel/social_identity_signaling/blob/main/code/FNs_genBachStravinsky_v0055k_assort_FLIP7_rep_execNULLsig_SMARTmutation.py), which must be located in the same directory as the notebooks for them to work properly. The code was only commented for my own use, and I am happy to provide further explainations of the code via email correspondence. I always record the random entropy used to seed the random number generators so results can be replicated exactly if the need arises.
